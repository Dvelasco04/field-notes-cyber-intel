# field-notes-cyber-intel

Personal knowledge base focused on cybersecurity, cyber intelligence and encryption.

I use this repository as:

- A structured way to consolidate what I learn.
- A reference for core concepts, threat models and practical approaches.
- A public showcase of how I think and organise information in the security and intel domain.

## Main areas

- `crypto/` – Encryption, crypto-agility, post-quantum concerns, data protection.
- `intel/` – OSINT, HUMINT, GEOINT, threat intelligence lifecycle and analysis notes.
- `threats/` – Threat modelling, APTs, supply chain attacks and strategic risks.
- `blue-team/` – Detection, monitoring, threat hunting and defence strategies.
- `red-team/` – Adversary perspective, kill chains and emulation notes (high-level, no exploit how-to).
